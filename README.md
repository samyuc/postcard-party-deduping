# postcard-party-deduping
Problem 
Over the summer of 2018, I helped with the James Smith campaign’s Postcard Party Initiative. The staff received almost 100,000 names and addresses of registered voters who had voted for Democrats in the past but had not voted recently. This demographic was being targeted by the campaign’s GOTV efforts, and volunteers who wanted to hold Postcard Parties to send postcards to hundreds of these voters were assigned a couple hundred names at a time. Because the campaign was already at a fundraising disadvantage, the campaign wanted to ensure that all unique voters received a postcard before duplicates were sent out to make the most of donor money. 
This project contains sensitive information (voter names and addresses), so the files themselves cannot be shared. However, I will explain the methodology of how I deduplicated these spreadsheets.
The information came in three different formats:
A.	Master document format. This was the file of addresses that needed to be assigned to volunteers, and this spreadsheet contained the 97,000 names and addresses in the following format. 

|Name	| City	| State	| Five Digit Zip	| Four Digit Zip |	Address |
----------------------------------------------------------
|John M. Doe	| Greenville |	SC	| 29208 |	3725	| 16 Main St |
|Jane Roberts	| Mauldin	| SC	| 29206	| 3145	| PO Box #7274 |
|John R. Doe | Simpsonville	| SC	29201	|3266	| PO Box #7274 |
This file was given to the new staff members by the campaign manager who had previously been handling data in one of the two following formats.
B.	Before the postcard party initiative was handled by the staff members that I was working with, the campaign manager sent out names in individual Excel documents to volunteers in two different ways. The following method is very similar to the format of the master document, with the main difference being the presence of a unique VANID identifier. 

VANID	Name	City	State	Five Digit Zip	Four Digit Zip	Address
11111	John M. Doe	Greenville	SC	29208	3725	16 Main St
22222	Jane Roberts	Mauldin	SC	29206	3145	PO Box #7274
33333	Dorothy Adams	Simpsonville	SC	29201	3266	PO Box #7274

C.	The campaign manager also previously sent names to volunteers in the following way:

First Name	Last Name	City	State	Five Digit Zip	Address
John 	Doe	Greenville	SC	29208	16 Main St
Jane 	Roberts	Mauldin	SC	29206	PO Box #7274
John	Doe	Simpsonville	SC	29201	PO Box #7274

All the names in file formats B and C have already been sent to volunteers, so the end goal was to determine whether or not a person in the master file could be located in one of those two types of spreadsheets. 
An additional issue arose when I later realized that some of the data in the formats did not in fact follow the formats listed above at all, but these names were still valid addresses that needed to be deduplicated.
Name	City	State	Five Digit Zip	Four Digit Zip	Address
John M. Doe	Greenville	SC	29208	3725	16 Main St
The Doe Family	Greenville	SC	29208	3725	16 Main St

Name	City	State	Five Digit Zip	Four Digit Zip	Address
Jane Roberts and Cecilia Smith	Mauldin	SC	29206	3145	PO Box #7274
Jane Roberts	Mauldin	SC	29206	3145	PO Box #7274

When trying to compile these three separate files into one document, it becomes clear that each unique person needs to have an identifying key to determine whether or not the person is in the master file. However, problems arise when trying to create an identifier:
1)	We cannot use name alone as an identifier because cases like John M. Doe vs John R. Doe indicate two different people, but would appear to be the same in spreadsheets in format C. 
2)	We cannot use address alone as an identifier because cases like Jane Roberts’s address vs John Doe’s address, where the difference lies in a zipcode or city, would not be handled correctly. 
3)	We cannot use name AND address alone because cases like John M. Doe at 16 Main St vs John Doe at 16 Main St would not be flagged as the same person. 
Solution 
In order to account for all of these conditions, I created two unique IDs, one based on name and address, and one based on address and zipcode. This second identifier was especially useful in handling the second and third cases listed above. 
To do so, I parsed each separate word in the name column in Microsoft Excel  to separate first, middle, and last names, and to check for cases where appropriate formatting was not followed. I checked that formatting was followed by checking the number of columns a name took up (if it had more than 4 words, it was typically incorrectly formatted). I also created a new name field called Name1 for Format C, where first and last name were separated, by concatenating first and last name. 
I combined all the separate spreadsheets in formats B and C into two tables in Microsoft Access and imported the master spreadsheet as a third table. 
To catch all of the exact matches, I ran the following queries:
SELECT FB.Name1, FB.Address, PM.Name1, PM.City, PM.State, PM.Zip5, PM.Zip4, PM.Address
FROM [Format B ] AS FB, [Postcard Party Master] AS PM
WHERE (((FB.Name1)=[PM].[Name1]) AND ((FB.Address)=[PM].[Address]) AND ((FB.Zip5)=[PM].[Zip5]) AND ((FB.City)=[PM].[City]) AND ((FB.State)=[PM].[State]));

SELECT FC.Name1, FB.Address, PM.Name1, PM.City, PM.State, PM.Zip5, PM.Zip4, PM.Address
FROM [Format C ] AS FB, [Postcard Party Master] AS PM
WHERE (((FC.Name1)=[PM].[Name1]) AND ((FC.Address)=[PM].[Address]) AND ((FC.Zip5)=[PM].[Zip5]) AND ((FC.City)=[PM].[City]) AND ((FC.State)=[PM].[State]));
These queries alone caught 3000 duplicates between the master file and the addresses already sent to volunteers. 
Following this, I used the two identifiers to find other duplicates. 
SELECT FB.ID, FB.Name1, FB.Address,  FB.Zip5, PM1.Name1, PM1.Address, PM1.Zip5, PM1.ID
FROM [Format B ] AS FB, [Postcard Party Master] AS PM1
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(SELECT Name1 
FROM [Postcard Party Master] AS PM
WHERE FB.Name1 = PM.Name1) and
(PM1.Address=FB.Address AND
PM1.Zip5=FB.Zip5) 
UNION ALL SELECT FB.ID, FB.Name1, FB.Address,  FB.Zip5, PM1.Name1, PM1.Address, PM1.Zip5, PM1.ID
FROM [Format B ] AS FB, [Postcard Party Master] AS PM1
WHERE FB.Name1 = PM1.Name1 AND 
FB.Address = PM1.Address AND 
FB.Zip5 = PM1.Zip5 AND
FB.City = PM1.City AND 
FB.State = PM1.State
ORDER BY FB.ID;
This method was repeated with the Format C names. New tables of the matches were created from these two queries.
